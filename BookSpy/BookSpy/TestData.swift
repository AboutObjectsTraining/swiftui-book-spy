But Prince Hamlet cannot be certain of his own reality. Did he really see a ghost? Is the vengeance his father demands just? Can he murder his own uncle to appease his father? The more Hamlet broods and schemes, a shadow over Elsinore is growing ever darker, until a case of mistaken identity leaves an innocent bystander murdered. Then the entire court descends into a spiral of madness, chaos, bloodshed, and suffering. Shakespeare's most famous tragedy is a bone-chilling examination of justice, revenge, and inaction.",
